# Reference Architecture
The High Level Reference Architecture consists of the following: 

1. **HBase** - as the system of record for the documents/images including thumbnails. 
2. **SOLR** - acting as the system of record for the the metadata and providing the indexing and searching capabilities.
3. When a user queries  for a content via metadata, we will use Solr to query the index. The  solr query will return a unique hbase row key which will be used to quickly retrieve the image from Hbase. 
3. **Kafka** - Documents will be pushed to Kafka for Streaming, Batch and B2B integration
4. **Spring Data Solr** - Set of scripts to setup the cluster
5. **Spring Data Solr** - Provides abstraction on top of Solr 
6. **Spring HBase** - Provides an abstraction on top of HBase
7. **Spring MVC** - Provides a REST interface to expose DocumentStore and IndexStore services

Hence this solution is a classic Hbase+Solr model to implement the search application.  Solr for text search on image metadata and HBase as a system-of-record for storing documents/images in it's original form as blobs.

## Business Use Case Setup

Common Use Case Requirements that see around re-platforming their existing ECM to HDP are the following:

*  Migrating image documents from the existing solution to the new solution creating services to ingest the image documents
* Creating image document ingestion services building on what was created for the migration ingestion
* Creating the index services on top of the document and metadata
* Creating an OCR/Analytics Framework for systematic mining of the image documents
* Ability to upload, index, update, retrieve and update documents and their corresponding metadata via the following mechanism:

# Reference App Development Artifacts
This project is meant to be a reference application/assembly for an IOT use case. The project consists of 5 projects:

1. **ecm-core** - Core capabilities/APIs for the DocumentStore and IndexStore. This will be used by the streaming and online applications.
2. **ecm-streaming** - Storm Topology for the Document Porcessing. Uses ecm-core to interact with Index and Image Store
3. **ecm-ambari-view** - An Ambari View for the the ECM Reference App
4. **ecm-ingestion** - Provides ingestion utilities such as: Custom Kafka Flume Sink that supports storing a serialized "DocumentUpdateRequest" object and Customer Flume DocumentInterceptor that extracts metadata of the document from the file name
5. **ecm-common** - Common Classes used by the above 4 projects including: Common API DTO classes and Common Utilities

# Architecture around the Core Document and Indexing Services
The below UML class diagram demonstrates how the different projects are used together.
